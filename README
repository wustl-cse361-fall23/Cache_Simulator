Cache simulator that takes in the given cache configuration and a valgrind tracefile. It returns hit_count, miss_count, eviction_count,
dirty_bytes_evicted, dirty_bytes_active, and double_references.

After compiling, run test-csim to load up and execute simulation on the trace files found in the traces subdirectory.
You can add your own valgrind traces for any program run to test a given cache performance.
